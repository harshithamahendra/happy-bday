                <p>To my little one,
                    <br>A very happy birthday! It feels great to wish you every year since this is the time of the year I always look forward to, more because of it being your birthday than mine. :)
                    <br>I have thought a great deal of what to write to you about this time. I thought it will be meaningful if I wrote something related to your current circumstance. I hope I don't bore you out like I usually do in our conversations.
                    <br>Turning 20 may feel pretty old. I did feel old too, though I didn't look anything like the age ;). I recently saw a few clips and writings online that conveyed that age is just a number. Thinking of it, it does make a lot of sense. Treat yourself however you want to be, regardless of the age because sometimes it is the number that restricts us from doing certain things thinking we are too old or too young for it. Please don't get me wrong. I am not influencing you to do anything bad ;). Honestly, I don't like accepting that you are a big girl and can take care of yourself. I like to be possessive of those whom I love. It has had some side effects, especially when I questioned a lot about your career plans but that doesn't mean I will ever stop worrying about you or keep an eye out on every step you take. Sorry, you are stuck with me for life. With that being said, I have let you experience things on your own like your relationships because there are some things you need to learn by yourself. I am sure your experiences in the past have made you a stronger person today.
                    <br>In this journey of life, we meet a lot of people, some of them who become very dear to us and other who add on to our memories and fade away. Man is a social being and everyone will need a loved one to share things with, to care for and sometimes support each other thorough the struggles we face. That being true, you should also know that at the end of the day, we are all fighting our own battles. It all comes down to how each one of us handle it. Remember, no matter what happens, it is important for you to have the courage and the strength to fight, even if you are the last one standing. We wish for our loved ones to stay with us forever but we mortal beings are going to have to learn to find happiness in the presence and the absence of the ones we care about.
                    <br>This might be quite an over whelming phase now that you are deciding what you want to do with your life. You keep hearing a lot of finding ones passion, following ones heart and making the right career choice. Some find what they want to do pretty early in life and they are happy with it and some don't. It is ok and absolutely acceptable if you don't know what you want to do with your life right now. One of the hardest things in life is to find your passion. Take this time to try different things you think you are good at that will make you happy. There is nothing called a cheap profession, so it is ok to get your hands on anything that pushes you forward. Do not be clouded by the expectations of those around you or the money making strategies that looks very appealing to the eyes. Money is one of the basic necessities but it is ideal to find what you love doing and that pays you enough for your living. Take as long as you want to make a career, even a year off discovering different things may lead to the right track. No matter what you do I am already proud of what you are. Do not hesitate to reach out for any kind of advice or help. Always remember, you are doing this for yourself, not as a favor to anyone else.
                    <br>Some of the things I admire in a human being, being humble and modest about your achievements, empathy, thirst for knowledge, kindness, sense of humor, enthusiasm, fearless to try something new, giving, selflessness, respect oneself more than anyone else, appreciation, simplicity, respect one another, love.
                    <br>Have a wonderful birthday and a beautiful, productive year ahead. Can't wait for your next one. I will always be there for you, always.
                    <br>'Stay hungry, stay foolish' - Steve Jobs
                    <br>Love,
                    <br>Akka.
